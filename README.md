## Hi, I'm Mario!
I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Minnesota, advised by [Dr. Maria Gini](https://nextgenai.umn.edu/team). After completing the IB Diploma in Beijing, I attended Sarah Lawrence College in New York for my undergraduate education to get an interdisciplinary education. I got lucky when I was assigned my First Year's Studies seminar, because it ended up shaping my academic trajectory. In the class, I read a book called GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid by Douglas Hofstadter, which explored the mysteries of consciousness and intelligence through music, mathematics, and computer science. It was my first exposure to programming and artificial intelligence concepts, and it inspired me to take all of the computer science classes that I could. I reinforced what I learned by tutoring computer science and mathematics for the university. After graduating, I gained work experience in software development and collaborating in teams. Now, as a PhD student, I am focusing on machine learning and multi-agent systems.
